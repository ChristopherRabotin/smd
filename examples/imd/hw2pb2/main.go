. NASA launched the Dawn spacecraft in September 2007 on a mission to study two protoplanets of
the asteroid belt, Vesta and Ceres. Dawn arrived at Vesta in July 2011 and stayed for approximately 14
months. When Dawn departed Vesta on September 5, 2012, it was on a heliocentric orbit with radius
of periapsis 2.17 AU and radius of apoapsis 2.57 AU. The protoplanet Ceres has a period of 1682 days
and an eccentricity of 0.0758. Determine the transfer time of flight using the following assumptions:
