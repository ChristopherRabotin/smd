# Space Mission Design (smd)
Space Mission Design allows one to perform an initial space mission design, around a given celestial body or between celestial bodies.

This package was written to support my thesis and my astrodynamics courses at the University of Colorado Boulder.

# Features
_Note:_ this list may not be up to date with the latest developments.
- Propagation of an orbit around a celestial body
- Direct closed-loop optimization of continuous thrust via Naasz and Ruggiero control laws.
- VSOP87 support via the amazing https://github.com/soniakeys/meeus
- Patched conics for interplanetary missions
- Stream orbital elements as CSV for live visualization of how they change
- Export as a set of NASA Cosmographia files (cf. http://cosmoguide.org/) for really cool visualization of the overall mission
